If you are using Azure to host your ASP.Net Core website and donâ€™t want to spend time configuring logging in your web application, then you can use Azure App services logging. Here are the changes that you need to make in your web application to configure logging.

***Startup.cs:***

```
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices;
public class Startup {
  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) {
    services.Configure < AzureFileLoggerOptions >
      (Configuration.GetSection("AzureAppServicesLogging"));
  }
}
```

***AppSettings.json:***

```
{
  "AzureAppServicesLogging": {
    "BlobName": "Log.txt"
  }
}
```
