Here are some of my tips to pass the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Exam.\

a. I used [Stephane Maarek's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02/) to study for my exam. As a alternative to that, [Brian Cantrill course](https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-saa-c02) is also very highly recommended on various AWS certification forums. \
\
b. Take detailed notes using an app like [Typora](https://typora.io/).

c. Deep dive into topics like

* VPC: Understand the differences between using a VPN and Direct Connect.
* S3: Bucket policies vs. access control lists, S3 encryption options, Storage types, Lifecycle policies
* RDS: Multi-AZ Replication, Read Replicas, Understand snapshots
* KINESIS:  Kinesis: Streams vs. Firehose vs. Analytics, Kinesis vs. Redshift vs. EMR, Athenaâ€™s differences from Kinesis
* LAMBDA: Limits/timeouts, Events and what services are generally used with Lambda triggers

d. Purchase the practice tests from [TutorialsDojo](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-practice-exams/) and work through them.\
\
e. Before the exam, I used [Tutorials Dojo's Study guide](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/product/tutorials-dojo-study-guide-ebook-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/) to refresh my concepts. 

f. For the exam, always use the process of elimination for every question. \
Also a lot of questions are designed to be tricky. Always read the question twice. \
\
Best of luck.
